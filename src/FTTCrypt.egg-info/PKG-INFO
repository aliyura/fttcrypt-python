Description: FTTCrypt stands for File to Text Encryptor, it is a software library built for text encryption and Files converting & encryption to a small ciphertext purposely to enhance file upload and transfer. Imagine sending a file from User A to user B, the file has to be uploaded into a server or network then the receiver to downloads the file. According to FTTCrypt, you are not uploading a File, but a small, encrypted cipherText that represents the file which means you can store the cipher in a database level and access the file using the cipher anywhere the FTTCrypt runs. No need for a large file or blob storage for your next application. Save your files within your database as a cipher.
